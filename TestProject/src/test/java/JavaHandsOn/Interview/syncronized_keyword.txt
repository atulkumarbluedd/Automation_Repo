In Java, the synchronized keyword is used to control access to critical sections of code or methods,
and it is not directly applied to classes as a whole. However, you can use the synchronized
keyword with methods and code blocks within a class to achieve synchronization.
Here are two common ways to achieve synchronization within a class:

Note >> class can not be syncronized.
only two ways as shown below


>> Synchronized Methods:
>> Synchronized Blocks:

using syncronized block

public class MyClass {
    private Object lockObject = new Object();

    public void someMethod() {
        // Non-critical code

        synchronized (lockObject) {
            // Critical section of code
        }

        // Non-critical code
    }
}

2nd way >> using syncronized method

 public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
        // Critical section of code
    }
