How to prepare for performance Test
> get approvals from stakeholders
> get application and environment
> Requirements for the test > what exactly we want to test
> Test data
> Expected behaviour or Base Line (from stakeHolders)
base line > for 10 users what is the avg time, all the matrix in the tabular format
> what will happen if we are increasing the user from 10 to 100 and so on.
> suppose you dont recieve from them then you create on your own base line.

Test plan > it is simillar to project where we have thread groups and listeners, default

Thread group > collocection of users and virtual threads
it has number of threads:
 ramp up period : (suppose you have given ramp up period for 10 users is 20 secs then in every 2 sec one user to be added ),
 Loop count

Q> what is tear down thread group
> this thread group will be executed once all the existing thread group's execution got over then at last it will be executed
Q> what is set up thread group ?
> this is just like before class method in testng

******************************* controllers *******************
1. samplers 2. logical controllers
> they are called controllers because they are the element which are actually processing the requests
Http request sampler > if you are testing the web application
FTP request sampler > if you are running FTP request
JDBC request > if you are running database tests

Logical controllers :
these controllers are used to determine the results in which the results are processed
***************** listeners ************************

what is the deference b/w stop and shutdown
> shutdown works gracefully but stop is just stop the thread

Tree | graph | tabular listeners
we can provide the file then results will be saved there
what simple data listener do
> it will simply store the data into the file provided will not log the data in the jmeter console
Q> how to run test using cmd
> jemeter -n -t "location of jmx file" -l "location of result file or csv"
Q> how to add assertions
> go to thread group > add > assertions
: response assertion
: Json assertion
: size assertion
: HTML assertion
: xpath2 assertion
: xpath assertion
: duration assertion
Q> what are config elements
Ans These elements are executed first if you have these before executing any tests
: csv data config
: http header manager
: HTTP cookie manager
: HTTP cache manager
: HTTP request default

Q> Timers
: thse are just to simulate with the real word
i.e. if user comes then they simply not keep on filling the data, they take some pauses and then do some activity etc.
generally we add "think time" and here we add "random count timer"

Q> what is template
>

Q> test fragment ?
A> using include_controller or Module_controller. The usage is to code reuse with the test plan.

Q> what is not test elements
: http request recorder : very much used
: Http mirror server : rarely used
: Property display : you can check all the properties of jmeter/system.

Q> Execution order
:configuration elements
:Preprocessors
:Timers
:Samplers(actual requests)
:Post-processors
:Assertions
:Listeners

Q: best practices
: always specific environment
:Run you same tests with same infra and resources with same network stats
:create more realstic performance tests : use think times and pauses
: always ramp up : means slowly add users
: always have a baseline to compare tests

Q: http cookie manager
A: whenever we login into any website then we get one cookie which is session cookie
and website differentiate using session cookie whenver any resources are asked
and this session cookies stored inside the browser
and for this we have to add this sampler
just add it under the thread group it will automatically store the cookies and use it in the further requests.
we will get under the thread group config elements


Q: basic
