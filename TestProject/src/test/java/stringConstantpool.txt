String str1 = "Hello"; // Created in the String Constant Pool
String str2 = "Hello"; // Reuses the same reference from the pool
String Constant Pool:

<<The String Constant Pool>> is a special area within the heap that stores literal strings.
When you create a string using double quotes (e.g., String str = "Hello";), the JVM checks the String Constant Pool.
If an identical string already exists in the pool, the existing reference is returned instead of creating a new object.

<<Heap memory>>


The Heap is a more general-purpose area of memory where objects,
including strings created using the new keyword, are allocated.

String str3 = new String("Hello"); // Created in the Heap, separate object
String str4 = new String("Hello"); // Created in the Heap, another separate object


Strings created with the new keyword always result in new objects in the heap,
even if an identical string exists in the String Constant Pool.
The String Constant Pool is managed by the JVM, and the heap is subject to garbage collection
