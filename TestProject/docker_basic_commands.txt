 ssh > secure shell > it is protocol to connect another server
 default port for ssh client connection is 22 
 we can change the default port and use one b/w 1024 and 32,767
 make sure you have user is created in the another server 
 ssh user@ip_of_theother_server
 enter password of the user 

 another way >> without password using ssh key 
 steps 1. generate ssh key pair in local machine
 steps 2. Copy public key to Remote machine (ssh-copy-id kali@ip_of_another_Machine) >> it will ask passowrd for one time, next time it will not ask pwd.
 Steps 3. login to server without using password


commands to generate key-pair

 ssh-keygen
 ssh-copy-id

ifconfig to check the ip of the linux machine 
ssh kali@ip_of_remote_machine

A>  service that keep on running on background
Example : httpd, sshd, chronyd
Q> check if service is running or not ?
A> systemctl status service_name
Q> check how much space a directory is taking >> du
q> %age of usage in directory is checked by >> df -h
Q> size of data usage in directory >> du -h
Q> wheenever we run a programme then one unique id is generated i.e. pid
to check if a process is running or not we use >> ps
ps -ef | grep processid or name
Q> kill and kill-9 diff >>kill -9 will close forcefully
Q> check a server is accessible or not > ping or telnet
Q> check port status >> netstat -tln
Q> check open port in linux >> netsat -putan | grep :22
Q> check network interface >> netstat -i or ifconfig
